Brainstorming Notes:

Designa is an open-source tower defense game focused on creating effective systems to acquire and utilize resources.

As you play, you collect resources, unlock maps, learn skills to unlock new tools, and feel like you're accomplishing something.

When you spawn into a world, you have just yourself and a couple trees to cut down and scrap to collect. As you dig into the ground,
 you set up drills (wood and scrap, simplest version) and connect pipes (wood, simplest) to them to pump resources to something.

You could pipe resources into a Simple Assembler (4 copper, 2 tin) to make other objects (with the correct recipe), or you could pipe resources into your
Crate.

You have a very limited inventory. You can only hold four different items, 100 each. Your best bet is to let your Crate be your master inventory.

Your crate is a special object that holds all of your collected resources and uses them when you create something automatically.
It has a limit to the amount it can hold, but you can't leave until you kill a certain amount of enemies.

The enemies are robots: Either they are spawned on the ground and walk, or spawn in the sky and fly, they are after your Crate.
They also will destroy your machines and buildings along the way, if kept out in the open.

You can create towers that can take care of enemies, or create factories that output a specific item to use in another factory.

The waves of enemies happen at night. Use the sun as your clock.

Protect your Crate! Gain resources! Maybe even make buildings where your own robots work.

If you, yourself die, you loose half your resources! So be careful. You do respawn, though.

If your crate is destroyed, you lose.

You don't do any fighting yourself (not yet), all of your fighting is done by your machines

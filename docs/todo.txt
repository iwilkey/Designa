These things need to be done, but don't need to be done in order (unless marked important)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important now
-------------

- REBUILD APP UP TO THIS POINT USING LIBGDX! <-- Almost done, except for Inventory and Item system.

- The method I'm using to find the highest tile isn't really the best because, if there is a tile + threshold that is over the
    world height, then the back dirt will spawn.

- Tiles need to drop resources when broken!
		
- Create a simple placement system
	- If the item exists in the inventory of the Player, it can be placed.

For later on
------------

- Look into building a terrain tile rendering system that renders different graphics based on what tiles are around them.

- Consider changing the inventory graphic?

- Create more tiles! (See Tiles list in docs)

- Create more items! (See Items list in docs)

- Create the Crate item.
	- Another inventory with many slots (depending on level) For now, 25 should be fine.

- Create resources such as Trees and Scrap (Most general)
	- Either make a sprite for them or...
	- Make them as an array of tiles?
	
- Make workbench (Standing near it gives a GUI to make items)
	- The item workbench

- Make workbench GUI
	- When player is near workbench and press 'E' a GUI will be brought up of all items they can craft with things
	in their crate and inventory

- Create minerals such as Copper and Tin
	- These can not be mined by hand, but a Drill can be placed on them to mine them.

- Create the drill and pipe system. lamo I'm thinking Mindustry
	- This won't be terrible for just one drill and pipe, but they will get more complex as drills are near each other.
	- Just start with one.
	- This will need it's own package most likely. Very complex. Look at Mindustry's code for inspiration?
	
- Create simple Turrets and / or weapons
	- Simple AI will need to be created.

- Create ground and air enemies
	- These are Creatures in the Entity package.
	- Simple AI must be created.
	
- Create worlds for players to try and beat

- Make more pleasing backgrounds, and try and use the layer system to parallax them when moving

- Check out how this can become an iOS / Android app

- Add more to this list.

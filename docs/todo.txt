These things need to be done, but don't need to be done in order (unless marked important)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important now
-------------

- Clean up the look / GUI of the blueprint system. It changes now that resources are added.

- Add the resource tiles to the blueprints and add a next page if it spills over

- Frame rate drops when you open inventory because the item blueprints check every tick if they can be created. Doesn't need
to happen that way.

For later on
------------

- Create the drill and pipe system.
	- This won't be terrible for just one drill and pipe, but they will get more complex as drills are near each other.
	- Just start with one.
	- This will need it's own package most likely. Very complex.

- Create simple Turrets and / or weapons
	- Simple AI will need to be created.

- Create ground and air enemies
    - These are Creatures in the Entity package.
    - Simple AI must be created.

- Create a save / load system that saves the world file and the inventory

- Create main menu / world creator / settings state

- Look into building a terrain tile rendering system that renders different graphics based on what tiles are around them.

- Make more pleasing backgrounds, and try and use the layer system to parallax them when moving

- Release for alpha on Itch and Steam, and make the github repo public. Keep the game open source.

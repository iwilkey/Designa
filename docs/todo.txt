These things need to be done, but don't need to be done in order (unless marked important)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important now
-------------

- Create settings state

- Keep working on the pipes and machines! These things need to at least be done before early access release
    - Each machine type needs to be linked to the position where the machine tile is at?
    - Offloaders need to offload items to pipes / crates in the right direction
    - Pipes need to be able to transport items from one side to the next
    - Mechanical drills need to be able to offload whatever resource they are mining at a certain speed
    - There needs to be a machine that can change the direction of a pipe. Offloaders?

- Add the resource tiles to the blueprints and add a next page if it spills over

For later on
------------

- Create a wave system (Brought on by nightfall)

- Create simple Turrets and / or weapons
	- Simple AI will need to be created.

- Look into building a terrain tile rendering system that renders different graphics based on what tiles are around them.

- Release for alpha on Itch and Steam, and make the github repo public. Keep the game open source.

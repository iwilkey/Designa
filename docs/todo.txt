These things need to be done, but don't need to be done in order (unless marked important)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important now
-------------

- Create minerals such as Copper and Tin
	- These can not be mined by hand, but a Drill can be placed on them to mine them.

- Create the drill and pipe system.
	- This won't be terrible for just one drill and pipe, but they will get more complex as drills are near each other.
	- Just start with one.
	- This will need it's own package most likely. Very complex.

- Create simple Turrets and / or weapons
	- Simple AI will need to be created.

- Create ground and air enemies
    - These are Creatures in the Entity package.
    - Simple AI must be created.

For later on
------------

- Create different textures of trees to render at different times of the day

- Look into building a terrain tile rendering system that renders different graphics based on what tiles are around them.

- Create more tiles! (See Tiles list in docs)

- Create more items! (See Items list in docs)

- Create worlds for players to try and beat

- Make more pleasing backgrounds, and try and use the layer system to parallax them when moving

- Check out how this can become an iOS / Android app

- Add more to this list.

These things need to be done, but don't need to be done in order (unless marked important)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important now
-------------

- Check the waves. See if the right bots spawn based on days survived.

- Increase bots speed based on days survived.

- Save & Load:
    - Entities active (and health)
    - Items in pipes

- Game Over screen when dead that shows waves survived.

- Release for alpha on Itch and Steam, and make the github repo public. Keep the game open source.

For later on (after release)
------------

- Create settings state
    - Full screen mode
    - SFX vs Music volume
    - Other shit
- Document every class for open-sourcing.
- Look into building a terrain tile rendering system that renders different graphics based on what tiles are around them.
- Sandbox mode! (No resources needed to spawn things, infinite health, and maybe flying)

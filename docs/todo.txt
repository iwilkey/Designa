These things need to be done, but don't need to be done in order (unless marked important)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important now
-------------

- Create settings state

- Create a wave system (Brought on by nightfall)

- Create simple Turrets and / or weapons
	- Simple AI will need to be created for it

- Release for alpha on Itch and Steam, and make the github repo public. Keep the game open source.

For later on (after release)
------------

- Document every class for open-sourcing.

- Add the resource tiles to the blueprints and add a next page if it spills over

- Look into building a terrain tile rendering system that renders different graphics based on what tiles are around them.

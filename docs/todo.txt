These things need to be done, but don't need to be done in order (unless marked important)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important now
-------------

- Create a wave system (Brought on by nightfall) (TIMER 20 mins with, x min (decided by amount of bots) nightfall),
    and keep track of the nights the player survived.
    - Spawn (wave * 10) Terrabots 100 blocks from the player on either side.
    - Increase nights player survived when all Terrabots are dead.

- Save & Load:
    - Time of day
    - Entities active (and health)
    - Player health
    - Player "score" (nights survived)
- Release for alpha on Itch and Steam, and make the github repo public. Keep the game open source.

For later on (after release)
------------

- Create settings state
    - Full screen mode
    - SFX vs Music volume
    - Other shit
- Document every class for open-sourcing.
- Look into building a terrain tile rendering system that renders different graphics based on what tiles are around them.
- Sandbox mode! (No resources needed to spawn things, infinite health, and maybe flying)

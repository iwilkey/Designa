Designa -> KING OF THE HILL. Become a online only option. Must play with others. You connect to servers that have worlds running and
you kill or team up with others. Leaderboard is how many kills you have before you die (then its reset).

Do this using the technologies
    Client (This)
    Node.js (Server)
    Socket.io (Socket for global game servers)

Code I might need to use later:


    boolean done = false;
    InputStream inputStream = new URL("http://download1334.mediafire.com/995i0jyjiwfg/8gazdntgpcss85x/Designa-alpha-v.1.0.1.jar").openStream();
    Files.copy(inputStream, Paths.get("C:/Users/User/Desktop/libGDX/projects/designa/android/assets/downloads"), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
    File oldFile = new File("C:/Users/User/Desktop/libGDX/projects/designa/android/assets/downloads");
    File newFile = new File("C:/Users/User/Desktop/libGDX/projects/designa/android/assets/designa.jar");
    boolean f1 = oldFile.renameTo(newFile);

    ProcessBuilder builder = new ProcessBuilder("java", "-jar", "C:/Users/User/Desktop/libGDX/projects/designa/android/assets/designa.jar");
    Process process = builder.start();
